This does do the livetime corrections. For straylight sources the motion of the telescope pointing/mast shouldn't affect the response of the instrument, and we'll assume that we'll take care of computing the effective area when doing spectroscopy. **Note:** this wrapper has a \"barycorr\" option, but it is currently disabled. If you're doing pulsar timing with stray light then you'll probably want to construct the nuproducts call yourself."
